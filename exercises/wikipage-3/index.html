              In a story that was written for the ages, and that will go down in Valorant Esports history, FNATIC continued their winning streak going 2-0 in the best-of-five match up. However, things got scary for the Black and Orange organisation after dropping the following two maps to make it 2-2 heading into one final decider.

              In the final map, Icebox, the map that FNATIC’s team has become world famous for dominating, the team quickly fell round after round resulting in a 3-11 score which seemed impossible to turn around. After a tactical time out, FNATIC’s IGL Boaster turned around the momentum and switched the team back on, winning round after round in a historic comeback. After equalising at 11-11, FNATIC closed out the show with a 14-12 to win the trophy in a 3-2 triumph.
