                Meet Remi, a charming 9-month-old purebred Border Collie with boundless energy and a brilliant mind. Remi's previous owners, while well-intentioned, discovered that his energy was a bit too much for them, as they may not have fully realized the energy levels of a Border Collie when they first brought him home. However, his enthusiasm and intelligence make him an incredible companion for the right family.

He can be the life of the party during playtime, but once he's had his fill of fun activities, he knows how to unwind and enjoy some downtime. Remi is the type of dog who can happily relax with you after a day of adventure, snuggled up on the couch, content in your company.
