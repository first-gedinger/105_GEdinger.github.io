            <h2>Howdy, I'm Graci Edinger</h2>
            <p>
                I've always had a creative side to me, but have always been a bit of a computer nerd. So I found the best of the both worlds!

                Around 5 to 7 years ago, I experienced a captivating immersion into the world of photography. This initial fascination subsequently sparked a journey of exploration into the realm of Lightroom, which seamlessly propelled me into the realm of Adobe products. Gradually, I embarked on a self-guided process of mastering their applications in a versatile manner. Periodically, I engaged in projects intended for sale and beyond. As time progressed, the notion crystallized that this could potentially evolve into a lifelong pursuit. And so, here I stand today, driven by the realization that photography could indeed shape my enduring path.
