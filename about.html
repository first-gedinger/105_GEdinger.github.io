            I've always had a creative side to me, but have always been a bit of a computer nerd. So I found the best of the both worlds!

        A few years ago, maybe like 5-7 years, I got really into photography. This then led to learning about Lightroom. And from there out I was sucked into using Adobe products. So I slowly taught myself how to use them in a general manner. Every now and then doing a project that I would use to sell, etc. Then I decided this could be something I might want to do in the long run, so here we are.
